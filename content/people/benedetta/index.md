I'm Benedetta Mariani, and I currently work under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis and  prof. Stefano Vassanelli.

I'm interested in the applications of statistical mechanics to complex systems, in particular to the neuroscience field, addressing these topics also with data analysis.

Indeed, in my work of thesis I analyzed data of rat neural activity in order to test the criticality hypothesis in the rat somatosensory cortex, focusing  on the impact of a sensory input; my current research will continue in these directions.
