I am Samuele Lipani a theoretical physicist with a strong background in interdisciplinary research and data science. I have collaborated with LIPHlab to enhance my Master's thesis work with Jacopo Grilli on serial dilution in consumer-resource modeling. Additionally, I conducted mobility analysis at INFN Padova with Samir Suweis during the same year.
Currently pursuing a Ph.D., I focus on polymer modeling of local chromosome dynamics, exploring genome organization and gene regulation mechanisms. My research delves into the roles of topologically associated domains (TADs), loop extrusion, and the estrogen receptor alpha (ERÎ±).
I am committed to unraveling the complexities of living systems and contributing valuable insights to the fields of biophysics and genomics.
