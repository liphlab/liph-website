My name is Andrea Marchetti, and I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padua, under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan.

I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from the University of Padua, with an experimental thesis on the biophysics of neuronal cells conducted at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa. I then completed a Master's in Physics of Data at the University of Padua, with a theoretical thesis on the mathematical ecology of complex evolutionary systems out of equilibrium, carried out at Imperial College London under the supervision of Prof. Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen.

I am primarily interested in the application of statistical mechanics and stochastic processes to ecological and biological systems, with a special focus on the analytical development of individual-based models. My current research spans tumour ecology and metapopulation theory. Specifically, I am developing a stochastic model of cancer invasion based on microscopic laws, aiming to study how stochasticity influences the aggressiveness of the invasion process. Additionally, I am working on the development of metapopulation models for multi-species ecological communities.
