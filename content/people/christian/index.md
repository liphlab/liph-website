My name is Christian Grilletta and I am a graduate student in Physics at the University of Padova.

During my Master’s Degree I increased my interest in Non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics and Physics of Complex Systems and I worked on my Master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Samir Suweis.

I am currently a research fellow at LIPh and I am working on the development of my Master’s thesis project, investigating the properties of the disordered Lotka-Volterra equations.
