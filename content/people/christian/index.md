My name is Christian Grilletta, and I am a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padova.

I obtained my Master’s degree in Physics from the University of Padova, where I worked on my Master’s thesis at the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Samir Suweis, investigating the properties of the disordered Lotka-Volterra equations.

During my Master’s studies I developed my interest in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and physics of complex systems, particularly their ability to describe simple emergent patterns from complicated systems of interactions. My research focuses on applying these powerful tools and methods to the complex systems which are common in nature, specifically within ecology.
