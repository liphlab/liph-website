I am currently a postdoc working with Judit Gervain and Samir Suweis in
partnership projects between the Psychology and Physics Departments at
the University of Padua where my research is about a description of the
critical behavior in newborn babies brain through avalanche occurrence
analysis with Electroencephalogram data. Additionally, I am working on
the establishment of a physical framework to describe music-movement
behavior in 6-to-24 months old babies. In a previous research I worked
together with Ricardo Marinez-Garcia at ICTP-South American Institute
for Fundamental Research (São Paulo - Brazil) where we established a
Stochastic Model for a Microbial Competition Dynamics with Public-
Good production ruled by Quorum-Sensing involving game theory,
discrete non-deterministic individual interaction models, and mean-field
approximations. In 2021, under the supervision of Carlos Fiore, I got my
PhD in Physics from the University of São Paulo (Brazil) where I focused
my learning to the field of Statistical Mechanics emphasizing the
emergence of phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems in which the
individual interaction dynamics are governed by probabilistic rules. I
acquired my fundamentals on Data Analysis and Complex Systems
concepts in my Master in Physics course at Universidade Estadual de
Maringá (Paraná - Brazil) where under the supervision of Renio dos
Santos Mendes we studied the Parliamentary Presence of the Brazilian
Chamber of Deputies through an Anomalous Diffusion conceptual
framework. In La Paz - Bolivia from where I am, I got my Bachelor in
Physics at Universidad Mayor de San Andres, where guided by Flavio
Ghezzi, we were aimed to study the wind power potential of a specific
Andean region of Bolivia. Since the beginning of my academic trajectory I
got fascinated by the field of Complex Systems due to its wide theoretical
foundations in statistical mechanics, computational tools and the interplay
between physics and other fields. I am happy and thankful to have found
people full of human values everywhere I had been at.
