My name is Luca Taffarello, and I am a research fellow at the Padova Neuroscience Center, University of Padova, Italy. I conduct my research under the supervision of Prof. Samir Suweis and Prof. Amos Maritan within the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics.

I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padova. My academic background provided me with a strong interdisciplinary foundation, allowing me to integrate concepts from statistical physics, dynamical systems, and computational modelling to explore fundamental questions in complex systems and particularly in neuroscience.

My research is driven by a deep interest in understanding how cognitive functions and behavior emerge from the complex organization of neural circuits. My aim is to investigate how brain dynamics emerge across multiple scales, how they are altered in neurological disorders, and how targeted interventions could restore normal function. By integrating theoretical models with empirical data, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of brain function.
