I have an academic background in chemistry, which I studied at the University of Bologna.
During my doctorate in Physical Chemistry, I started developing an interest in the study of stochastic processes, with a particular interest in the extraction of information from the fluctuation in experimental measurements.  My PhD  thesis focused on the development of decomposition and denoising techniques for experimental data.
Pushed by my curiosity and my interest in interdisciplinary projects, I recently joined the LIPH lab working on a PRIN project focused on the analysis of the neural activity of Zebrafish.
In general, I have a strong interest in programming and computer stuffs and in science dissemination.
