My academic background is in physics, which I studied at the University
of Padova and the Free University of Berlin. I hold a Ph.D. in
Theoretical Physics from the Humboldt University of Berlin. My interests
are centered at the intersection of physics and biology. One prominent
aspect of my research revolves around investigating the effects of noise
in biological systems. By studying noise-incorporating models and
comparing their predictions to experimental data, I strive to understand
how stochastic elements influence the dynamics of diverse biological
networks, encompassing neuronal circuits and ecological communities. In
addition to my primary area of focus, I am actively exploring the
application of nonlinear methods for analyzing human brain data, aiming
to uncover potential associations with pathological conditions.
