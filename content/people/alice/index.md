My name is Alice Doimo and I am a Ph.D. student at the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics of Università degli Studi di Padova, where I obtained both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics.

I am currently working at the developments of my Master's thesis project on the topic of pattern formation in ecosystems with resource competition, under the supervision of Professor Amos Maritan and Professor Sandro Azaele.
Specifically, the purpose of my project is to clarify the role of spatial effects on species coexistence.

I am mainly interested in the statistical mechanics approach to complex systems, particularly in the context of living systems and theoretical ecology. 
What I like the most about this research field is its interdisciplinarity and its theoretical approach that maintains however a strong connection with reality.
