My research activity is at the interface between dynamical systems theory, statistical physics and computational neuroscience. My main interest is on the temporal coordination of neuronal networks in the brain: how does the synchronized activity of neurons lead to emergent phenomena such as perception and cognition in the nervous system? My studies converge to the central idea that neural synchronization phenomena are fine tuned by homeostatic balance that maximizes information processing at the cognitive level, and that the breakdown of this delicate mechanism can lead to pathological over-synchronized states such as those observed in epilepsy and Parkinson disease. Following these ideas, I have investigated the relationship between neuronal synchronization and the emergence of consciousness, from the point of view of statistical mechanics. Another subject of my research is on the relationship between cognitive processes and the underlying stochastic properties of neural activity, mainly investigating drift-diffusion models of decision making.
