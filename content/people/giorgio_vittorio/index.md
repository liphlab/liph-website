My name is Giorgio Vittorio Visco and I am a PhD student at the LIPh Group.
I graduated from the University of Padua with a masterâ€™s degree in Physics under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan. I am interested in statistical mechanics and physics of complex systems. In particular, I am fascinated by the theoretical/mathematical side of this subject. 
The interdisciplinarity of this branch of research and the possibility of exploring a broad class of systems is, for me, very exciting. My goal as a researcher is to investigate formalisms to describe and understand systems of ecological and biological character. 
My PhD supervisor is Prof. Samir Suweis, and our work is part of the project BIOcen5D. We collaborate with the Zoological Station Anton Dohrn, and the aim of this research activity is the study of oceanography and marine ecosystems by developing and implementing physical-mathematical models.
