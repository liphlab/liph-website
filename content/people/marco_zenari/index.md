My name is Marco Zenari, and I am a Ph.D. student at the Padova Neuroscience Center, University of Padova, Italy. I conduct my research under the supervision of Prof. Samir Suweis and Prof. Amos Maritan in the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Trento and a master's degree in Physics of Data from the University of Padova. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical physics and data science, enabling me to approach complex systems with analytical rigor and cutting-edge, data-driven methodologies.

My research focuses on unraveling the intricacies of neural circuits to better understand how the brain processes information. By combining theoretical models with advanced computational techniques, I aim to uncover fundamental principles governing brain function. I am particularly interested in leveraging interdisciplinary approaches, such as statistical physics, network science, and machine learning, to shed light on the organization and dynamics of recurrent neural networks.
