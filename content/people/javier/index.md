Hi! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the LIPh Lab.

My research focuses on tackling interdisciplinary problems from the perspective of 
theoretical physics:  using minimal models to explore how robust macroscopic patterns emerge from plausible microscopic processes. 
Additionally, I work on developing efficient numerical methods for generating stochastic paths in processes of interest in complexity 
science.

At the LIPh Lab, my current work examines the relationship between empirical measures and minimal models. I 
investigate the impact of empirical procedures on observed data and how we can systematically and accurately infer models from this data.
