This project is aimed at investigating the processes that shape macrobiomes biodiversity and disentangle the roles played by both ecosystem self-organization processes and endogenous environmental ones. We will use the power of statistical physics and top-down approach of complex system theory to establish in-depth understanding of the fundamental and quantitative principles driving the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity together with massive data analyses of public available datasets.<br>
